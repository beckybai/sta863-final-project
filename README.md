# sta863-final-project
Implement two algorithms so far. 
## SIVI
This is written in tensorflow, refer to [github](https://github.com/mingzhang-yin/SIVI) and [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/yin18b/yin18b.pdf). 
## MCMC
This part is written in [pytorch](https://pytorch.org). Using the GPU to do the matrix calculation can increase the speed of MCMC when the dataset is large.
## data
Two datasets are used, [waveform](https://github.com/mingzhang-yin/SIVI/tree/master/data) and [a9a](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html)

## TODO
Change the MCMC to parallel MCMC.
